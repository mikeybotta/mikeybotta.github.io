        <p>Thanks for stopping by to check out my website! This has all been hand-coded from scratch, which
            I am sure you can tell. We are still very much in the 'scratch' stage here. My journey in development began
            in early
            November 2022 with HTML and CSS, which right now I am focused on mastering. Next up is JS!</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I am learning through a mixture of self-teaching strategies. My first experiences with development in college
            have long since been
            forgotten, but growing up on a computer has naturally made me <em>rather good</em> at anything tech-y. Well,
            besides development.
            So I started refreshing my skills using gamified platforms like Sololearn, and now I'm enrolled in a
            self-directed bootcamp from Colt Steele.
